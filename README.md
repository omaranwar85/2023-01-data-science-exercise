# 2023-01 ICRAR Data Science Exercise by Omar

## Unable to make the repository private

Will be pushing the python scripts and final README to the repo just before the deadline. 

1. Fork this repository into your own GitHub account (if you use clone your name will be visible in the original repo).
1. All your work will be done in your repository.
1. Inspect the data and understand what is available.
1. When going through the exercise, create git commits and pushes, making a history of changes that can be inspected later.
1. The exercise should be completed in Python 3.9+.
1. Your git repository should be structured and populated using a standard Python project template for application development, which other people might reuse.
1. Create a __README__ file in the root of your repository, explaining how to run your code.
1. At the end of the exercise, you will __have__ to push your code to your GitHub repository and allow access to the following Git-Ids: [KevinVinsen](https://github.com/KevinVinsen) and [awicenec](https://github.com/awicenec). 

## Details

The two objectives of this exercise are:
1. Produce cleaned and consolidated data files suitable for loading by another process (which is not part of this exercise).
1. Produce a visualisation showing significant events/features in the data.
